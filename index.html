    <h3>
      The first video game prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s were simple
      extensions of<br />
      electronic games using video-like output from large, room-sized mainframe
      computers.<br />
      The first consumer video game was the arcade video game Computer Space in
      1971. In 1972 came the iconic hit game Pong and the first home console,
      the Magnavox Odyssey. The industry grew quickly during the "golden age" of
      arcade video games from the late 1970s to early 1980s but suffered from
      the crash of the North American video game market in 1983 due to loss of
      publishing control and saturation of the market.<br />
      Following the crash, the industry matured, was dominated by Japanese
      companies such as Nintendo, Sega, and Sony, and established practices and
      methods around the development and distribution of video games to prevent
      a similar crash in the future, many of which continue to be followed. In
      the 2000s, the core industry centered on "AAA" games, leaving little room
      for riskier experimental games. Coupled with the availability of the
      Internet and digital distribution, this gave room for independent video
      game development (or "indie games") to gain prominence into the 2010s.
      Since then, the commercial importance of the video game industry has been
      increasing. The emerging Asian markets and proliferation of smartphone
      games in particular are altering player demographics towards casual gaming
      and increasing monetization by incorporating games as a service.</h3>
